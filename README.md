# Get_Next_Line

Get_next_line - 'cos we're all tired of using 'read'

Concepts covered:
- understanding 'read'
- buffer management
- static variables
- linked lists
- optimizing your code for speed and conciseness
- memory manegement
- ... and making sure segfaults never happen!

Get_next_line returns the next ... line (you got it!) from a file, which is really useful for parsing files. The actual return value is 1 if a line has been read, 0 if the reading is completed or -1 if an error has occurred (oh no!).

This get_next_line can handle multiple file descriptors and only uses one static variable (bonus challenges imposed on us at 42).

Get_next_line has been added to my library Libft. [Check it out!](https://github.com/JanWalsh91/Libft)
